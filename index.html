                <dt>Are all shoes more or less the same?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Yes, if you imagine surfing for example, you don’t surf every wave with the same board. There are long boards for small waves and short boards for medium waves and different boards again for large waves, and then within those sections there are variations again. </p>
                        <p>Running shoes are the same, there are trail shoes, road shoes, track shoes, cross country shoes, fast and slow shoes, shoes for short runs and long runs. Even within trail shoes there are so many options, there are ones for muddy, ones for gravel, ones with more cushion than others, it goes on.</p>
                    <p>In a simple sense, my all time favourite “jogger” (something I wear for long days, short days, one road and gravel and non steep trail) and also doesn’t mind going a bit faster if need be is the New Balance 1080. An incredible shoe... For me.</p>
</dd>

                <dt>What shoes should I get?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>That’s not so simple. It depends on where you plan to run, what you’re trying to achieve from your running and of course your budget. Also, just because 1 person loves a certain pair of shoes, doesn’t mean you will.</p>
                        <p>The best thing you can do is go to a store such as “The Running Company”, and I recommend the Albert Park, Clifton Hill and Geelong stores. Here they’ll get you on a treadmill and analyse YOUR style and ask you the right questions, plus they’ll actually get you to RUN in all the different shoes and not walk up and down the aisle in Rebel. Plus, unlike those bigger chains, they’re not incentivised to sell you certain shoes by sales reps. These other chains are literally encouraged to sell you a certain brand/model of shoe. </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>How many shoes do I need?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Firstly, one thing to consider with running shoes depending on how much you intend to run is the longevity of the shoe. The shoes have foam and this foam gets compressed when you run and takes time to recover. Depending on how often you run, you might get more longevity out of the shoe if you cycle between 2 pairs. 1 pair,  being worn regularly will “wear out” in ~500km’s, but if you cycle between 2 pairs and give the foam longer to recover you might get ~700km’s out of each pair, so almost a whole pair for free.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, as mentioned above, you might need different shoes for different runs. A road shoe and a trail shoe are designed quite differently and running on trails in a road shoe is going to decrease your level of enjoyment significantly, plus increase risk of certain injuries.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, rotating between 2 different styles of shoe can decrease injury. Shoes have different “drop”. Drop is the mm measurement of shoe thickness at the front and the back of the shoe, and the difference is the “drop”, ie. if there is 15mm of thickness under your heel and 8mm of thickness under the ball of your foot, that’s a 7mm drop. Some shoes are more stable than others, etc, and these factors load up (put pressure on) different parts of your body. By changing shoes, you can load different areas and give other areas a break, reducing the chance of injury.</p>

                <dt>What's up with Super Shoes/Carbon Plate Shoes?</dt>
                <dd>Shoes are continually advancing and improving, always have, always will. ‘Super shoes’ are the latest advancement and combine a new style of foam with a plate that keeps this cushion rigid. They feel amazing when used for what they’re meant for, which is running fast in more or less straight lines. They are designed for people running over a certain speed and not designed for jogging and you’ll find yourself in a pickle if you try to as the stability at slower paces is very poor. Are they cheating? No, in the same way that introducing spikes to shoes was not cheating. Are they springs? No. </dd>

                <dt>What’s the deal with barefoot running?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Barefoot running/zero drop (flat shoes) became obscenely popular after the book “Born to Run” became popular. While there are benefits to this, it’s also worth considering other factors. Barefoot running may be the natural way to run, but jogging in the modern way we do, multiple times a week, in a repetitive style, often over concrete and roads is far from natural.</p>
                    <p>The risk is inherently that cushioned shoes with drop allow heel striking (landing on your heel rather than the middle or front of your foot) which is bad. Having cushion under your heel will allow you to heel strike which potentially sends a lot of resistance and force up through your body. But you don’t have to heel strike. If you run with an okay technique then you have nothing to worry about (see: Technique).</p>
                    <p>I do have a pair of zero drop shoes (Altra’s) and I run in them very irregularly. I see the benefit and they load up (put pressure on) different parts of my legs to normal runners which feels good, but they’re not something I would run in regularly, but they’re a nice reminder and to make sure my form (technique) isn’t slipping. Some people like to occasionally do some barefoot jogging at a sports ground very irregularly for similar reasons, but I’m yet to meet any seasoned runner who wears zero drop shoes or runs barefoot regularly and gets good results from it. The risk v reward is not worth it.</p>

                <dt>Is running just running? I know how to run, right?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>To a degree, yeah, and many of the best runners in the world have ‘odd’ techniques that work for them. But if you think about any sport, basically the first thing you ever do is get technique lessons, yet with running, we don’t… why is that? It makes no sense. We just assume we know how to do it. The thing is, it’s so easy to over complicate and often you’re better off not changing anything. The main thing people often cite is not wanting to be a ‘heel striker’, or someone that lands heel first.</p>
                        <p>The way I like to think about this is not what part of your foot you’re landing on, but where your ‘foot strike’ is, or where your foot makes contact with the ground in reference to your body. The main thing I believe you want to avoid is ‘over striding’, where your foot lands out in-front of your body, which puts a breaking force back up through your legs and hips. In the interest of not over complicating this, there’s 2 things I recommend doing.</p>
                    <p>The first is to jog on the spot as you normally would and then just slowly lean forward from the ankle until you tip to a point that you have to start jogging forward. The second is when you’re running I like to imagine I’m a puppet on a string, with the string attached to my coccyx/tailbone that then runs up my body through the crown of my head and that’s getting pulled from above. When I do this I’m forced to stand up tall and everything else seems to take care of itself. My foot strike comes under my center of gravity, my shoulders are in a way that I can breath easily, I’m looking up and ahead so I’m getting air in easily, and all those things happen without having to think about them individually.</p>

                <dt>How often should I run?</dt>
                <dd>Let’s assume you’re just starting out. The main thing is consistency. More regular runs are better than longer, harder one off runs. And starting out, too many runs might make it all seem too hard as you’re not recovering between each. Based on your fitness I’d say anywhere between 2 and 4 runs a week would be ideal. If you’re able to run 2 days a week consistently that’s *checks notes* over 100 runs in a year, which is incredible! If you’re able to run 3 days a week, that’s great and means you have at least a day off between each run and is an amount I’d aim for, but you’ll still get results from twice a week and not hate your life.
</dd>

                <dt>How long should I run for?</dt>
                <dd>Let’s assume you’re just starting out. If you can jog 20 min in one go, that’s fantastic and what I’d aim for. If you can’t make 20 minutes there’s 2 things you can do. The first is to slow down (see: How fast should I run?). The second is what’s called a run/walk, where you might run for 4 min then walk for 1 min and repeat that 4 times to get to 20 min. You might go 3 min jog and then 2 min walk. It all works. I’d say aiming for 20 min is a good aim, even if some of that is made up of walking. Starting out if you’re coming from a place of fitness then I’d still say there’s not much point running more than 40 min at a time. You can get incredibly fit doing 4 lots of 40min runs a week and any more than that, without a coach building a plan specifically for you, is only going to dramatically increase injury risk without increasing fitness much at all.
</dd>

                <dt>How fast should I run?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>This is my main peeve and applies to beginners and certain ‘elites’ alike. Slow the f down.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, as stated before, consistency is key. Consistency will come from enjoyment. If you’re not enjoying your running, you’re not likely to do it consistently. If you’re going out and killing yourself every single run you’re going to come home exhausted and then start to dread the next run. Running can be fun, it can be a time to think, take in views and to explore. It doesn’t have to suck.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, you’re probably not better off by going faster. In simple terms, you have an aerobic system which burns fat and you can think of that as just your general fitness. Then you have an anaerobic (without air basically) system that’s used in high intensity situations. To work the aerobic you actually need to go slow, and to work the anaerobic system you actually need to go fast.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately what most people do is run in the ‘grey zone’, which is in between the both but not training either. This means every run is uncomfortably hard, but you’re not getting any benefit. You’re increasing injury risk, not getting particularly fitter and adding dread to the next run.</p>
                    <p>Quality training requires ‘polarisation’, where your hard days are hard and your easy days are easy. If your easy days aren’t actually easy, then you won’t be able to go hard enough on your hard days to get the most out of them. Even if you don’t have hard days, there’s still no point to running in the grey zone.</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>So what is slow?</dt>
                <dd>It changes for everyone, for some people it might be 4:30/km, and for others it might be 7min/km, the main thing is to check your ego at the door and chances are you should run slower than what you think. If you don’t have a GPS watch (which is absolutely fine) then a good gauge is that you should be able to say a full sentence at any time without having to take a breath midway through. If you can’t hold a relaxed, casual conversation, then you’re going too fast. You should be finishing your run with a light puffed feeling and looking forward to going again in a couple of days or so. Obviously, your first couple of weeks you might be more than lightly puffed, which is to be expected as you adapt, but if you’re really puffed then you should consider adding in walk breaks during your run (see: how long should I run for?).</dd>
